## Description:
Workshop Metadata Extract (WME) is a Python library that allows you to extract metadata from Steam Workshop files. It provides a convenient way to retrieve various details about workshop files such as the creator's information, file size, creation and update times, and more.


## Installation
Before using WME, ensure that you have the following requirements installed:

- Python 3.x
- Requests library

To install the requests library, run the following command:

```shell
pip install requests
```

## Usage
To use WME, follow these steps:

1. Import the WorkshopExplorer module and set your Steam API key:

```python
import WorkshopExplorer as WME

WME.API_KEY = "YOUR STEAM API KEY"
```

2. Create a WorkshopItem object with the workshop file URL:

```python
map_item = WME.WorkshopItem("WORKSHOP_FILE_URL")
```

3. Retrieve and work with the workshop file metadata. For example, to download the map:

```python
map_item.download_file("path_to_save/")
```
